Welcome to the DEKI technical test.

Start with : `yarn` or `npm i` in `client/` and `server/` to install dependencies.

To launch the client or server: `yarn start` or `npm start`
To start the server with nodemon: `yarn dev` or `npm dev`

You must create a CRUD api for users data (no need to modify the data in the file).
You have to display the data in the client using MUI.

You have 3 / 4 hours to do it, the goal is not to finish but to see your way of coding and how you did it.
